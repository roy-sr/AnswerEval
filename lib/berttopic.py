Natural language processing has its roots in the 1950s. Already in 1950, Alan Turing published an article titled \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence, a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language, but at the time not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence.

    eval_text_to_process5 = "Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This is a widely used technology for personal assistants that are used in various business fields/areas. This technology works on the speech provided by the user, breaks it down for proper understanding and processes accordingly. This is a very recent and effective approach due to which it has a really high demand in todayâ€™s market. Natural Language Processing is an upcoming field where already many transitions such as compatibility with smart devices, interactive talks with a human have been made possible. Knowledge representation, logical reasoning, and constraint satisfaction were the emphasis of AI applications in NLP. Here first it was applied to semantics and later to the grammar. In the last decade, a significant change in NLP research has resulted in the widespread use of statistical approaches such as machine learning and data mining on a massive scale. The need for automation is never ending courtesy of the amount of work required to be done these days. NLP is a very favourable, but aspect when it comes to automated applications. The applications of NLP have led it to be one of the most sought-after methods of implementing machine learning. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field that combines computer science, linguistics, and machine learning to study how computers and humans communicate in natural language. The goal of NLP is for computers to be able to interpret and generate human language. This not only improves the efficiency of work done by humans but also helps in interacting with the machine. NLP bridges the gap of interaction between humans and electronic devices."
